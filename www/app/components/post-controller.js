        <p>I have a MySQL connection through SSH that I have configured on Sequel Pro but like the idea of using this Atom
          package, data-atom, instead. My issue is that I cannot seem to figure out the js behind it to determine if it
          supports an SSH connection and if so how I can accomplish it with the configuration.</p>

            <p>You will notice that the basic controllers and html structure has been setup for you. You will be responsible
              to connect each of the controllers to their appropiate service. Every Service is a class so be sure to invoke
              the service inside the controller and save it to a variable in the controller to gain access to the needed
              methods. Take a look at the weather controller for an example of newing up the services. Also don't forget
              to instantiate your controllers and add them to the app object.<span class="user-info">â€“ <span class='blue-text'>Username</span>
